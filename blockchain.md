It's important to realize that the true Bitcoin/Blockchain innovation is actually in this very specific trust setting of a dynamically changing set of database maintainers. If your use case doesn't call for that, if you can designate the maintainers at the start of your protocol and have them authenticate to each other, then you don't need the full Blockchain toolkit. You need only fairly standard cryptography and your use case was achievable 20 years ago.

NFTs are used in instances where uniqueness and provable scarcity is valued (such as in digital art and collectables)
